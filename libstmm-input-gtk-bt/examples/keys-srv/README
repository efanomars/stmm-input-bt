keys-srv
========

keys-srv is a sample application that uses the stmm-input-gtk-bt library.
It prints out to the terminal the keys received from bluetooth clients apps,
according to a very simple protocol.
This example code shows how to use the BtGtkDeviceManager as a stand-alone
device manager. If you want it to be loaded as a plugin instead, try the
examples of the libstmm-input-gtk-dm library (stmm-input repository).
