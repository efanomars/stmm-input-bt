.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Gtk GUI application that creates a virtual keyboard by connecting to a
bluetooth server started by libstmm-input-gtk-bt (on another computer).

.PP
It looks for surrounding detectable bluetooth devices creating a list
from which, the server to connect to, can be chosen.
.br
The \fB--extra-server\fR option can be used when the bluetooth address
of the server is known. This avoids the scanning step (which may take many
seconds) and allows one to connect to an undetectable device.

.PP
The server it connects to creates a virtual cable with the keyboard
represented by the client device.
This means that once connected, this program can disconnect (maybe accidentally)
and reconnect at will. This is useful, for example, while playing a game:
the virtual keyboard doesn't need to be reassigned to the player when bluetooth
fails momentarily.
The virtual keyboard has to be removed from the server explicitly when connected.

.PP
The GUI allows one to define a custom grid and assign to each of its cells a key.
Cells can be pressed with the mouse, by touch or by pressing the assigned key
on the (physical) keyboard.
