stmm-input-btkb is a gui client for the libstmm-input-gtk-bt server.

It communicates with the server over bluetooth with a custom protocol
called btkeys.

When it is connected to a server it is added to it as a device with 
keyboard-like capability.

The server keeps the device associated with the client even when
the client is disconnected. The device removal must be explicit.

The GUI allows to select a server, connect to it and disconnect from it.

While connected key presses and releases can be sent to the server by
pressing on buttons with the mouse.

  $>stmm-input-btkb --help

to find out how to connect to a non detectable server and customize
the behaviouor of the program.
